# for python number and text are NOT same
# if we write,
x = 30   # this is integer
y = 30.0 # this is float
z = '30' # this is string

# You can validate by checking the data type of each declared variable
>>> print (type(x))
< class 'int'>
>>> print (type(y))
< class 'float'>
>>> print (type(z))
<class 'str'>
